## About The Project
SurrealFlask is a Python Library that utilises class structures to easily create data structures in SurrealDB and make these locally accessible through an API interface. The idea is to define your DB objects quickly to use them in in your Flask Application. Ideal for PWA, SPA, and IDB.
